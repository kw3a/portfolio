The original device functioned as a composite USB HID, so I wrote the firmware in C using the STM32Cube framework. To ensure full compatibility with his existing systems, I designed the new interface as a logical clone of the original. Although I had no prior experience in firmware development, I adapted quickly and successfully delivered a working solution.",
